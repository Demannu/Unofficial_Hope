mission_text.sql holds the text - unimportant for us - we need a file and a number.
thus mission_types.sql should hold the amount of missions in the file.

the table mission_terminal_mission_types will connect the terminal to the mission_types given

the table mission_spawn_areas will hold spawn areas for missions, 
the table mission_spawn_area_terminal will connect terminals with spawn areas
the table mission_spawn_types will connect mobs with spawn areas for missions
